## Game Controls

Here's actually anything that you need to know about this game!

There's not much to say, also you can learn the game yourself. It's so simple!

### Target

Your main target in this game is to defeat the monster and also not to be defeated!

### Attack

The primary way to deal damage to the monster.

When clicked, a bar will show up with a single indicator that shows the damage you will deal if press Fire. But first you need to hit start to make the indicator move.

The more center the indicator is the more damage you will deal!

### Special Attack

This is the second way to attack the monster which is more powerful and deals more damage!

This attack will be available after completing 5 rounds and when used, you need to wait 5 more rounds.

### Heal

I guess the name says what it does!

To be honest, healing won't affect so much. The main thing it does is to buy time for you until you can use the Special Attack.

### Surrender

I guess it would be better if i renamed it to **Restart**. Because surrendering in this game actually doesn't mean anything. ðŸ˜‚

**Note**: every action in a single round will be logged at the bottom of the page.
